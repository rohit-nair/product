# Product Management

#### Why?
You will learn how to describe your unique experiences and most important accomplishments. You’ll learn how to tackle problem-solving questions. You’ll understand what it means to think about the user. And, finally, you’ll solidify your technical skills.

## What is a PM?
PM is responsible for making sure the team ships a great product.

Mini-CEO of their product, responsible for minor to big picture. Sets vision and strategy, defines success and makes decisions. Diverges from CEO as doesn't have direct authority over people. Need to influence them with your vision and research. Don't boss around.

Appealing as it sits at the intersection of technology, business and design. Wear multiple hats. Highly collaborative.

Advocate for the customer. Translate their needs to goals and features, built in a cohesive and well design way.

### Functions

Research & Plan > Design > Implement & Test > Release

Some places split these functions into 2 roles:
* Product Manager: Involved in Research & Plan, Release
* Technical Product Manager: Design, Implement & Test

### Research & Plan

Stage where PM is thinking what to build. Idea may come from one of the following channels:
* Customer request
* Competitive Analysis
* New Technology
* User Research
* Sales or marketing teams
* Brainstorming
* Big vision of the product.

Big part is creating/proposing a roadmap. Create large list of features/dev work. Prioritizes work. And thinks deeply about the problems being solved and goals of the feature set.

Once roadmap is ready, she gets other on board. In a top-down (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon) approval org, executives and directors get involved. In a bottom-up org (Google, Facebook, startups) PM focuses on winning over the engineers.

Starts defining success. Many companies use Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to communicate most important goals to the team. Works with team to come up with measurable results it can commit to.

### Design

Once agreement is formed on what team is going to build, it's time to design it. Design $\neq$ UI/Wireframe. Product design is defining the features and functionality of the product.

#### Scenario 1
Companies that ship products (as opposed to online), MSFT, PMs create detailed functional specification (spec) that includes:
* Goals
* Use Cases
* Requirements
* Wireframes
* Bullet points describing every possible state of the feature
* Internationalization
* Security...

Spec is then reviewd and interated on by team and other PMs. PM expected to make user-facing decisions.

#### Scenario 2
Looser spec and rapid design process. PM and Interaction Designer brainstorm and iterate on mock-ups. Once done, sent to engineers with a few sentenses. Engineers make easy product decisions and ask PMs regarding difficult ones.

#### Scenarion 3
In companies like Apple, a design done by dedicated design team with minimal input from PM. PM is essentially doing project management and fire fighting.


**Note**: Due to varying process, good to ask about the process in interview. Who you are working with in core/extended team. How much time spent on writing specs and how much with designers. Learn where the balance is between PM, designers and engineers in making product decisions.

### Implement and Test

Keeps track and makes adjustments based on progress. Important part is to help engineers work efficiently. If engineers are stuck, find new tasks to do and follow-up with other teams to prioritize and finish work promptly.

If implementation turns out harder than anticipated, PM looks for ways to make features easy to implement. If engineers running behind schedule, PM reviews work and cuts low priority tasks. 

Gathers feedback and raises bugs on early versions. Use dogfooding, usability studies to get qualitative feedback. Run experiments (A/B testing) to get quantitative feedback.

As feedbacks/issues comes from above channels PM iterates through feature design to find better solution. Prioritization is PM's most important function.

### Release

Plans for launch. Tasks involve:
* Creating and going thorugh launch checklist
* Making sure teams that will support the product going forward (CSRs, SREs etc) are prepared.
* Preparing for all the things that could go wrong.

After launch, announces to rest of the company, celebrates and then either continues to support and iterate on product or prepares to do it all over again.
