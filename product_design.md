# Designing a Product 

## How a facebook designer thinks
[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b78zq-kimVs)

**Framework**

3 simple questions for anyone in Facebook thinks of while designing a product.

### Question 1: What **people** problem are we trying to solve?

People problem as a problem that people in the streets are facing. 

Characteristics of a good people problem:
* Human, simple and straight-forward. Doesn't use jargons or other internal or industry terms.
* Solutions agnostic. The problem doesn't state or hint at the solution, ie states a web app or a site etc.
* Facebook wins! - agnostic. People on the streets don't care whose solution it is. They just care whether it solves thier problem. So saying our/we/Fb or other pro/nouns doesn't get closer to the solution.
* Gets at the why. Get to the root/reason of the issue.
* Functional, emotional or social.

Ex:

> I want to talk about an interest with other people who are also interested, but I don't know where to find these people.

> Not everything I see in News Feed is likable -- I want more ways to easily express how I'm really feeling about something.

### Question 2: How do we know this is a real problem?

*know*: Quantitative and qualitative evidence. Focus group and research helps answer this question.

*real*: is it worth solving? Worth as in worth the time, energy and other resources. Opportunity cost.

### Quesiton 3: How will we know if we've solved this problem?

*Set mesurable goals and metrics*

* When we put it out there, what would be different in the world?
* Best to address this before hand (before launch) so that you are not biased or innundated with the data that is coming in after launch.
* Mesurable means when we get that data we know what that data means.

Ex:

Problem 1:
> People join more groups after going through the Discover tab

> People engage and get value from the groups they've joined.

Problem 2:
> People share more feedback with Reactions than they did previously

> Each Reactions gets a fair amount of usage (also in all regions)

> People who recieve Reactions on their posts consider them valuable

1. What problem are you solving?
   1. Can you state the problem clearly?
   2. Have you experienced it yourself?
   3. Can you define the problem narrowly?
   4. Is the problem solvable?
2. Who is your Customer?
   1. Everyone? (no!)
   2. How often do they have the problem?
   3. How intense is the problem?
      1. Plot Frequence vs Intensity and ones in right quadrant are the best.
   4. Are they willing to pay?
   5. How easy are they to find?
3. Does your MVP solve the problem?
4. How to set up metrics?
   1. GA + something else
   2. Pick 5-10 important stats. If paid customer, then Revenue is your north star. If not, then usage based metrics such as DAUs (Daily Active Users).
   3. Make measurement part of product spec.
5. Product Development?
   1. KPI goal
   2. Brainstorm
   3. Categorize tasks as Easy/Medium/Hard
   4. Decide on what to work on
   5. Write spec (very important for teams to be in sync)
6. Pivot vs. Iterate?
   1. Pivot = changing the customer and/or the problem (rare)
   2. Iterate = changing the solution (common)

> Design too important to be sole relm of designers. So the secrets needs to be shared in the open.

**Design Thinking Principles**

A focus on user outcomes -> Restless reinvention <- Diverse empowered teams

* Treat everything like a prototype.
* Treat everything as an unfinished product that will always be iterated on.
* Will always be re-invented.

**The keys to Design thinking at scale:**

* Hills: 
  * Aligns us across teams
  * Sets objectives for each team
  * Implementation agnostic, tells where to go not how to get there.

Example:
> 15 minutes could save 15% or more on car insurance.

* Playbacks
  * Aligns us across time
  * Opportunity to playback our observations, reflections and creations back to others in the team.
  * Tell stories from user's perspective.

* Sponsor Users
  * Align us with our user's reality
  * Our way to say we don't know everything
  * Close the gap and tighten the loop
  * They help us Observe, reflect and create.
  * Their contribution are equally as important.

Don't be afraid to ask questions. We think someone already knows the answer or thought about it. Prompts discussion. 

Be ok with ambiguity. 

Give the team space to fail. Give teams opportunity to be more audacious with their approach.



## Interview Strategy

### From cracking the PM interview
1. Ask questions to understand the problem
2. Provide a structure how you are going to apprach this problem. Call out which part of the structure you’re on. (Very important)
3. Identify who your Users and Customer are. The users and customers aren’t the same person. The customer is the **person paying for the product**; the user is the **one using it**. There also may be multiple users.
4. What are the use cases? Why are they using this product? What are their goals? For each user (if there’s more than one), make a list of the use cases.
5. How well is the current product doing for their use cases? Are there obvious weak spots?
6. What features or changes would improve those weak spots? Explicitly tie your feature ideas to the use cases or goals.
7. Wrap things up
